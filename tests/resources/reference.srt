But we don't forget.
We wait.

536
00:35:11,021 --> 00:35:12,501
We sharpen our teeth.

537
00:35:12,675 --> 00:35:15,678
And one day,
when he can't even remember

538
00:35:15,852 --> 00:35:18,159
that old woman's name...

539
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:20,292
well...

540
00:35:21,902 --> 00:35:23,338
I won't speculate on coincidence

541
00:35:23,512 --> 00:35:25,035
in front of an officer
of the law.

542
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:28,691
But you got assurances
this thing is over.

543
00:35:28,865 --> 00:35:30,563
Si?

rhythmically]

545
00:35:58,373 --> 00:35:59,809
Bang.

546
00:35:59,983 --> 00:36:02,029
ORAETTA:
Hi, hi, hi, Mr. Cosmopolis.

547
00:36:04,031 --> 00:36:05,772
Oh...

548
00:36:06,642 --> 00:36:08,514
Good morning.

549
00:36:10,298 --> 00:36:13,823
It's Nurse Mayflower again.

550
00:36:13,997 --> 00:36:16,609
How are we feeling
this fine day?

551
00:36:16,783 --> 00:36:19,089
-I...
-Hmm?

552
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:22,615
Oh. Well, a crisp fall Tuesday
is what it is.

553
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:23,920
Gobble, gobble.

554
00:36:24,094 --> 00:36:26,575
[chuckles]
Almost Thanksgiving.

555
00:36:26,749 --> 00:36:29,622

Turkey Day?

556
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:36,411
Hmm?

557
00:36:36,585 --> 00:36:39,414
Oh, you poor soul.

558
00:36:39,588 --> 00:36:42,852
You, your body
is just working so hard

559

It's not doing its job, is it?

bad, bad, bad.

And here the doctors say...

563
00:37:01,175 --> 00:37:04,700

they can do. [sighs]

and she can help.

567
00:37:10,706 --> 00:37:12,621
You want Oraetta's help, right?

568
00:37:12,795 --> 00:37:14,536
-Take the pain away?
-Yeah.

569
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,842
Yeah, yeah.

570
00:37:16,016 --> 00:37:17,713
Of course you do.

571
00:37:17,887 --> 00:37:20,847
Life's hard enough without
a lamb shank for a heart.

572
00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:24,198
Don't you worry.

573
00:37:25,634 --> 00:37:28,246
Your angel of mercy has arrived.

574
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:37,472
SNEET:
It's, well...

575
00:37:37,646 --> 00:37:40,040
I have to say, Nurse Mayflowe,

576
00:37:40,214 --> 00:37:42,477
highly irregular.

577
00:37:42,651 --> 00:37:44,653
Highly...

578
00:37:44,827 --> 00:37:48,178
not good is, well, what it is.

579
00:37:48,353 --> 00:37:51,051
Such a high dosage of...

580
00:37:51,225 --> 00:37:53,009
not even the proper medication.

581
00:37:53,183 --> 00:37:55,011
Resulting in...

582
00:37:55,185 --> 00:37:57,187
certain death, which...

583
00:37:57,362 --> 00:37:59,842
We can't have that.

584
00:38:00,016 --> 00:38:01,844
Patients come to us for care.

585
00:38:02,018 --> 00:38:05,544
Top quality care.
Not to be... mismanaged.

586
00:38:05,718 --> 00:38:08,068
Mr. Sneet, believe me,
no one's more embarrassed

587
00:38:08,242 --> 00:38:11,114
than little ole me.

588
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,682
But at the same time,
have you seen their handwriting?

589
00:38:13,856 --> 00:38:15,293
The doctors? Hmm.

590
00:38:15,467 --> 00:38:18,426
Like a cave painting
with a stick.

591
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,515
-N-N-Not, not that I-I...
-This isn't, I hate to say,

592
00:38:20,689 --> 00:38:22,996
the first time
we've had concerns

593
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:25,259
about your care.

594
00:38:27,043 --> 00:38:29,350
The level of care.

Patients passing untimely

596

or rushed to the ICU

597
00:38:33,572 --> 00:38:37,097
without biological provocation.

598
00:38:37,271 --> 00:38:41,057
Not to mention the pharmacist
has noticed some discrepancies

599
00:38:41,231 --> 00:38:44,278
in medicines requested
and medicines removed

In summation,

603
00:38:52,895 --> 00:38:56,116
after the latest unpleasantness,

604
00:38:56,290 --> 00:39:00,120
I don't see how
we can keep you on staff.

605
00:39:02,905 --> 00:39:05,038
I'm saying you're fired.

606
00:39:08,955 --> 00:39:11,436
I see how it is.

607
00:39:12,785 --> 00:39:15,744
Yes.
So, if you could

608
00:39:15,918 --> 00:39:18,268
-clear out your locker...
-A cover-up.

609
00:39:18,443 --> 00:39:19,835
Uh...

610
00:39:20,009 --> 00:39:23,535
An incompetence of doctors.
[scoffs]

611
00:39:23,709 --> 00:39:26,015
A few lost souls, and someone's
got to pay the piper,

612
00:39:26,189 --> 00:39:27,408
so old Oraetta's made the goat.

613
00:39:27,582 --> 00:39:29,367
Well, I am no goat, Mr. Sneet.

614
00:39:29,541 --> 00:39:31,369
Oraetta Mayflower,
she is no goat.

615
00:39:31,543 --> 00:39:33,022
-Now, Nurse...
-Call the police,
you're so concerned

616
00:39:33,196 --> 00:39:34,459
about malfeasance.

617
00:39:34,633 --> 00:39:37,026
About medicines removed
without dotted I's.

618
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,463
Heck, pick up the phone,

619
00:39:38,637 --> 00:39:40,160
tell them to send
the paddy wagon.

620
00:39:40,334 --> 00:39:42,380
Take this woman away
in silver bracelets.

621
00:39:42,554 --> 00:39:44,338
Or what about
call the news boys?

622
00:39:44,512 --> 00:39:47,776
-Now, hold on,
there's no need...
-This is America, sir,

623
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,778
last time I checked,
not Soviet Russia,

624
00:39:49,952 --> 00:39:51,345
where a man gets rationed
a quarter potato

625
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:53,129
and has no rights under the law.

626
00:39:53,303 --> 00:39:56,132
And here's you, sitting
like judge and executioner,

627
00:39:56,306 --> 00:39:59,397
tossing old Oraetta
on the bone pile, and for what?

628
00:39:59,571 --> 00:40:01,050
The inability
to read the handwriting

629

an epileptic?

severance sound?

00:40:27,903 --> 00:40:29,557
a glowing recommendation

638
00:40:29,731 --> 00:40:31,951
-to your next
potential employer.
-In writing.

639
00:40:39,698 --> 00:40:42,396
I have to say, Mr. Sneet,
I'm disappointed

640
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,659
in this institution.

641
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:46,182
In you.

642
00:40:46,356 --> 00:40:48,184
When our days are at an end,
and we stand

643
00:40:48,358 --> 00:40:50,273
before the Lord,
he will weigh the color

644
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,928
of our immortal souls
and judge us lacking,

645
00:40:53,102 --> 00:40:55,278
have we not shown
an unflagging commitment

646
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,716
to excellence in his name.

647
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:00,806
And if we have failed
in our devotion to him,

648
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:04,331
then you and I are going
straight to the hot place.
